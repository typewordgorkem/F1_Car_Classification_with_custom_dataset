# F1_Car_Classification_with_custom_dataset

This repository contains a Python implementation of F1 car classification using custom datasets. The goal of this project is to train a deep learning model to accurately classify different F1 cars based on images of the cars.

### Overview

In this project, we use several pre-trained deep learning architectures such as GoogLeNet, ResNet50, and VGG11 as the base models. These models have already been trained on a large dataset, so we can use their weights as a starting point for our own classification task. The custom dataset used for fine-tuning the models is comprised of images of F1 cars from various teams and seasons.
